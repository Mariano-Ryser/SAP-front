## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

check package.json to see dependecias
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.

It started as a virtual curriculum which later transformed into a blog, and then a complete server in which I continue testing and working hard to expand my knowledge on the subject.
This portfolio is built on Next.JS where my
frontend runs, and the backend is deployed
on Azure, the database interaction is
created with NodeJs and Mongo DB.
          

    If you have any good comments or constructive criticism,
 
    they are always helpful to me.
    
                    so I await your return!
