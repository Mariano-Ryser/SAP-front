  Mama, take this badge off of me
G               D          C
  Cause I can't use it anymore
G                   D             Am
  It's getting dark, too dark to see
G                   D                   C
  I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door

  I can't shoot them anymore
G                        D              Am
  There's a long black cloud coming on down
G                   D                   C
  I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
